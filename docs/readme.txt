About
=====
This is a simple Windows console app, which takes a bitmap image, and draws some text onto the image.

You can use this within a build system (for example from within an Ant script), to automatically update 
the splash screen of your application, with the correct version number.

The application is written in C# 2.0.

Tested on Windows XP Pro SP3.
